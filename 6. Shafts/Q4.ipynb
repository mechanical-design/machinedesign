    "A 1.6kW motor transmit power to transmission shaft with 72% efficiency at 110rpm. The shaft is supported by two bearing C1 & C2. Two pulleys A and B are mounted on it as shown in the Figure below. Power is transmitted from Pulley A to Pulley B with belt tension ratio of P1=5P2 and Q1=3Q2 respectively. The shaft is made from plain carbon steel having yield stress strength of 210MPa. Use maximum shear stress theory of failure with minor shock condition Kb=1.5 and Kt=1.2;\n",
